TECHNOLOGY PERFORMANCE CRITERIA
The desired generator technology is an energy-generating device that produces more output energy in usable, commercially viable power than is required to run the system.
1.  The technology is over unity (more output than input energy) and is commercially viable for running typical electrical appliances in homes, businesses and industry. The device must also provide the following features:

2. Be completely independent of the power grid. The device should be able to function as a complete "stand alone" system operating for an indefinite period of time with no connection of any kind to the existing electrical grid or any other power supply system. Ultimately, the device may be hooked to the grid to feed its own excess power back to the utility company but only after demonstrating its performance as a standalone system.

3. Self starting - the device should be able start from its own power supply; i.e. battery or capacitor.

4. Self charging - means should be included that enable the device to recharge its starting system from its own power while simultaneously running a load.

5. The device should consume no external fossil-based or nuclear fuels of any kind.

6. Significant usable power - ideally the device should deliver 5-10KW of net usable electrical power over and above what is needed to recharge its starting circuit / mechanism. This would be either 120 or 240V, 50/60 cycle, AC current sufficient to power typical household or commercial electrical devices; i.e. lights, computers, refrigerators, electric heaters, microwave oven, stereo, television, etc.

7. While a lower power prototype may likely be necessary for proof of concept / development, a robust demonstrator unit in the 5-10KW range is necessary to prove commercial viability of the technology. Such a robust demonstrator is essential for The Orion Project to fulfill its strategic mission.

8. This technology may involve unique circuitry, gearing and wiring of electric motors, alternators, etc. that result in this over unity effect; providing commercially viable power generation in the multi-kilowatt range, be self running and charging while simultaneously running a load.
